    <h2 class="desc">Description</h2>

    <p>
        Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. 
        Beat together buttermilk, milk, eggs, and melted butter in a separate bowl. 
        Keep the two mixtures separate until you are ready to cook.
        Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. 
        You can flick water across the surface and if it beads up and sizzles, it's ready.
        Pour the wet mixture into the dry mixture; use a wooden spoon or fork to mix until it's just blended together. 
        The batter will be a little lumpy which is what you want.
        Pour or scoop the batter onto the preheated griddle, using approximately 1/2 cup for each pancake. Cook until bubbles appear on the surface, 
        1 to 2 minutes; flip with a spatula and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.
        Serve hot and enjoy!
